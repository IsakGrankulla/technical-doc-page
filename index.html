            <h2>The background of Internet</h2>
            <p>The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol
                suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public,
                academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope. Internet was developed in year 1969 by the 
                US Defense Development Department which named it Arpanet. After that, universities in USA created a network to use privately

            <p>Computers connected directly to the internet are called <strong>"Servers,"</strong> while the computers you 
                and I use are <strong>"clients,"</strong> because they are not 
                connected directly to the internet, but through an Internet Service Provider.
                 Routers shuttle packets of information across the internet, and transmit e-mail, pictures, and web pages.</p>

                 <ul>
                 <li>Your modem is connected to a server which is connected to an <strong>even</strong> bigger server</li>
                 <li>Internet can be wireless, for example your phone's network 4G comes from a <strong>radiotower</strong> located near you. </li>
                 <p>Because the Internet is a global network of computers each computer connected to the Internet must have a unique address.</p>

            <p>
                    As of June 2018, 55.1% of the world's population has internet access. In 2015, the International Telecommunication 
                    Union estimated about 3.2 billion people, or almost half of the world's population, would be online by the end of the year. 
                    Of them, about 2 billion would be from developing countries, including 89 million from least developed countries in the world.
