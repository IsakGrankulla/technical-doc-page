            <h2>The background of Internet</h2>
            <p>The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol
                suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public,
                academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope. Internet was developed in year
                1969 by the
                US Defense Development Department which named it Arpanet. After that, universities in USA created a
                network to use privately

            <h2 id="second-title">How it works</h2>
            <p>Computers connected directly to the internet are called <strong>"Servers,"</strong> while the computers
                you
                and I use are <strong>"clients,"</strong> because they are not
                connected directly to the internet, but through an Internet Service Provider.
                Routers shuttle packets of information across the internet, and transmit e-mail, pictures, and web
                pages.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your modem is connected to a server which is connected to an <strong>even</strong> bigger server</li>
                <li>Internet can be wireless, for example your phone's network 4G comes from a <strong>radiotower</strong>
                    located near you. </li>
                <p>Because the Internet is a global network of computers each computer connected to the Internet must
                    have a unique address.</p>

            <p>
                As of June 2018, <strong>55.1%</strong> of the world's population has internet access. In 2015, the
                International Telecommunication
                Union estimated about 3.2 billion people, or almost half of the world's population, would be online by
                the end of the year.
                Of them, about 2 billion would be from developing countries, including 89 million from least developed
                countries in the world.

            <h2 id="text-4">Hackers</h2>
            <p>
                 There are many different hackers who only want to destroy, but not always.
                There is a group called the Anonymous who is focusing on bigger people or countries. Year 2011 in Oktober they stopped pedophiles who
                were posting child pornography on the internet, they stopped them by finding their information.
                Year 2013 they started operation Free Korea, where they tried to get Kim Jong-Un to give internet to the people of North Korea,
                they also got 15 thousand different names and passwords from databases and they threatened to release them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Internet is very important for hackers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People can ruin someone elses life by getting their information and sabotaging their personal life
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>There are three different types of hackers, you might 
                think that all hackers only exist to destroy, but 
                being a "hacker" can mean many different things
                White hats, Grey hats, Black hats.
                White hats job is to test companies securitys by breaking in so the companies can improve their website.
                Grey hats are not as illegal as Black hats since Grey hats are more personal hackers but 
                are still breaking laws.
                The Black hats are the "bad guys" as they break into companies to steal important information
                and such.</p>
